# Understanding the Zynq MPSoC Hardware Architecture

## Processing System (PS) Architecture

The Processing System in Zynq MPSoC is built around a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 Application Processing Unit (APU) operating at frequencies up to 1.5 GHz. These 64-bit processors support both AArch32 and AArch64 execution states, providing compatibility with existing 32-bit software while enabling the performance benefits of 64-bit computing.

The APU cluster includes a shared 1MB L2 cache with ECC protection, NEON SIMD engines for accelerated multimedia processing, and hardware virtualization support. Each Cortex-A53 core has its own 32KB L1 instruction and data caches, providing low-latency access to frequently used code and data.

Complementing the APU is the Real-Time Processing Unit (RPU), which consists of dual ARM Cortex-R5F processors running at up to 600 MHz. These processors are specifically designed for real-time applications and include tightly-coupled memories (TCM), floating-point units, and deterministic interrupt response times. The RPU can operate in lockstep mode for safety-critical applications or in split mode for dual independent real-time processing.

## Memory System and Interconnect

The Zynq MPSoC implements a sophisticated memory hierarchy designed to provide high bandwidth and low latency access to different types of memory. The system includes DDR4/DDR3L SDRAM controllers supporting up to 4GB of external memory, on-chip RAM (OCM) providing 256KB of low-latency storage, and various levels of cache memory.

The Cache Coherent Interconnect (CCI-400) ensures coherency between the APU, I/O coherent masters, and system memory. This is crucial for maintaining data consistency when multiple processors and DMA-capable peripherals access shared memory regions. The interconnect also includes quality-of-service (QoS) controls that allow prioritization of different traffic flows.

The Platform Management Unit (PMU) includes dedicated memory for firmware storage and execution. This unit manages power domains, clock generation, and system monitoring functions independently of the main processors.

## Peripheral Integration and I/O

The PS includes a comprehensive set of integrated peripherals designed to support a wide range of embedded applications. High-speed interfaces include multiple USB 3.0 controllers, Gigabit Ethernet MACs with hardware acceleration for common networking protocols, SATA 3.1 controllers for storage applications, and DisplayPort interfaces for video output.

Communication peripherals include multiple UART, SPI, and I2C controllers with different feature sets and performance characteristics. The system also includes GPIO controllers, timer/counter units, and watchdog timers for general-purpose control and monitoring applications.

The Zynq MPSoC includes dedicated security features such as a crypto acceleration unit, secure boot capabilities, and hardware-based root of trust. These features are integrated into the BSP to provide secure system initialization and runtime protection.

## Programmable Logic Integration

The tight integration between the PS and PL is one of the key differentiators of the Zynq MPSoC architecture. The Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) interconnect provides high-bandwidth, low-latency communication between the PS and custom IP blocks implemented in the PL.

Multiple AXI interfaces with different characteristics are available, including AXI4, AXI4-Lite for control registers, and AXI4-Stream for high-throughput data streaming applications. The PS includes master and slave AXI ports that can be configured for different data widths and operating frequencies.

The PL can also access system memory directly through coherent and non-coherent AXI ports, enabling custom accelerators to operate on data structures shared with software running on the PS processors.
